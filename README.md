# 🖥️ Macro Keyboard Project

### 🚀 Turning My Second Keyboard into a Macro Device

This is my effort to transform my **second keyboard** into a **macro device**, similar to a **Stream Deck**.  
I'm leveraging **[LuaMacros](https://github.com/me2d13/luamacros)**, a third-party software created by **[Petr Medek](https://github.com/me2d13/luamacros)**, primarily to differentiate between two keyboards.

## 🛠️ How It Works
✅ The **macro keyboard** writes events into a special `.txt` file.  
✅ My **custom Python script** continuously reads that file and executes functions accordingly.  
✅ Meanwhile, the **main keyboard remains unaffected** and functions normally.

## 📝 Lua Script
The file **`luascript.lua`** is based on a script from a **Linus Tech Tips** video 🎥:

I made modifications to suit my needs.
